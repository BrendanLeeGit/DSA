We'll have the game have a player and the dundeon linked list

cycle through the dungeon and then pass a player to it through the run method

have the ability to remove the dungeon the player just went to and then move on to the left or right

Dungeon Factory:
    Utilizes Monster factory to choose a monster if needed and runs a fight sequence

    Or can make it a trap or treasure room
